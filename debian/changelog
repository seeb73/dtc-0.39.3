  * New upstream release fixing the following:
    - [v0.30.19] Corrects some spelling issues in debian/control, adds the
    debian/source/format file (still format 1.0 as there's no need for patches,
    because upstream == debian maintainer).

      - Orders the "Add VPS" by server_hostname,vps_xen_name
      - check for existance of maildirsize before attempting chown

      - Using mkdir -p instead of just mkdir when creating a new user path.
    - [v0.30.20] Non debian-specific bugfixing as follow:
      - Removed the total_du warning in the "My Account" screen.
      - Now rendering the statistics table with CSS and not ugly html
      - Killed the code for "repairing" http_accounting table that was in fact
      reseting user bandwidth stats for the current month at each upgrade.
      - Now /dtcadmin (vs /dtcadmin/) works again
      - Renamed the HTTPRequest class to dtc_HTTPRequest in order to avoid
      conflicts with the PHP PEAR library.
    - Added a global graphic overview of VPS servers (I/O, CPU, net...)

  * Added pt.po portuguese translation for debconf messages thanks to
    Ricardo Silva <ardoric@gmail.com> (Closes: #415071).
  * All the db_input calls uses now || true so it also works with the
    set -e directive in the config script (see master.config).
  * createChrootTemplate is not called durring the postinst anymore,
    but now done in the userland install script (Closes: #414465)
  * README.Debian is less agressive about the policy (Closes: #414469)
  * Postinst checks for existance of /proc/net/dev before using it to

    to check if the package is using Sarge (this part is now commented, but

    not ask for changing the MySQL root password any more (Closes: #414484).

 -- Thomas Goirand <thomas@goirand.fr>  Wed,  7 Mar 2007 09:19:42 +0000

dtc (0.25.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Now using a dtc-common package to avoid conflicts between
    config files in /etc/cron.d and /etc/logrotate.d if someday
    a user switch between dtc and dtc-postfix-courier. Also,
    this makes both 2 packages (being in only dtc-common) having
    less files and reduce the overall size.
  * The chroot template is now built in /var/lib/dtc as default.
  * Now using a2enmod for enabling apache2 rewrite and ssl.
  * Long desc split in parts. (Closes: #403504).
  * Now using po-debconf internationalization (Closes: #402655).
  * The postinst doesn't modify other package config files anymore
    this is now done in a script to be launched manualy after the
    setup of the package (Closes: #402432).
  * Many changes to be debian policy compliant as requested in the BTS:
    - All things forbidden by debian policy removed from the postinst.
    - The user has to cd into /usr/share/dtc/admin/install and run
      ./install in order to have the install script modify the
      configuration files of the daemons this package (dtc or it's
      brother dtc-postfix-courier) uses.
    - The postinst script saves the values answered in debconf in
      /var/lib/dtc as they are needed for the 2nd stage as
      well (like path for hosted files, domain name, mysql password
      and so on) as otherwise it would raise a "debconf is not a
      registry" error in Lintian.
    Side notes: This has been said to be the correct way (eg: debian
    policy compliant). If there is a smarter way, I'm open to any
    suggestions, but consider that it's not nice to ask twice the
    same thing to the user to the package, and that splitting the
    setup script in 2 parts (because touching other package config
    file) is not a very nice feature already. Also, this is what
    have been advised me to do in different channels in IRC, by
    people in mentors (Closes: #402834).

dtc (0.24.6-1.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Non-maintainer upload from the sponsor :)
  * Disabled maintainer scripts:
    - The maintainer scripts are currently way too intrusive.

      (they are shipped in /usr/share/doc/{dtc,dtc-postfix}/ though).
    - disabled postinst check in rules.
