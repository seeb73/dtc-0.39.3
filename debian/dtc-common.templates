Template: dtc/conf_mysqlautoconfig
Type: boolean
Default: true
_Description: Automatically configure MySQL user?
 DTC can use /etc/mysql/debian.cnf to automatically create a root mysql user
 for DTC to access and manage MySQL and DTC's database. This way, no question
 will be asked to you about what MySQL root password is used, all will be
 automated, but the drawback is that the MySQL server that will be used will
 always be located in the local machine (you won't be able to configure DTC
 to use a remote database server).
 .
 In any case, please make sure that your MySQL root password is set. As per
 default, Debian installs it with a blank password. To set your MySQL root
 password, issue the following command: dpkg-reconfigure mysql-server-5.1.
 You've been warned!

Template: dtc/conf_ipaddr
Type: string
_Description: Primary IP address:

Default: /var/www/sites
_Description: Path for hosted domains:
 Please enter the directory to be used by DTC to store files for
 all hosted domains.

 therefore recommended to change the DocumentRoot setting in Apache
 configuration if you choose /var/www as path for hosted domains.

_Description: Apache version to configure:
 DTC supports both Apache and Apache2. Please enter the version
 which DTC should use.

Template: dtc/conf_use_nated_vhosts
Type: boolean
Default: false
_Description: Use "NATed" vhosts?
 DTC can configure Apache to use one of your IP addresses. If the
 server is firewalled with NAT and port redirections of public IP(s)
 address(es), a "NATed" vhost configuration can be generated.
 .
 This option should be chosen only if the server is not connected to
 the Internet directly, but through a firewall doing network address
 translation (NAT). If the server uses a dynamic public IP address,
 NAT and port forwarding are mandatory for DTC.

Template: dtc/conf_nated_vhosts_ip
Type: string
_Description: NATed LAN IP address:
 Please enter the IP address of the server for DTC to
 generate all vhosts that will be used by Apache.

Template: dtc/conf_gen_ssl_cert
Type: boolean
Default: true
_Description: Generate an SSL certificate for DTC?
 If you choose this option, DTC will generate a self-signed SSL
 certificate and will use SSL to browse the panel. SSL will also be
 activated and the generated Apache configuration will activate HTTPS
 URLs for the control panel.
 .
 This certificate can be changed for a root CA certificate later.
 .
 Previously-generated certificates will never be overwritten. To
 regenerate the certificate, you need to remove all the files in
 /usr/share/dtc/etc/ssl.

Template: dtc/conf_cert_passphrase
Type: password
_Description: DTC certificate passphrase:
 Please choose a passphrase to protect the generated SSL certificate.

Template: dtc/conf_cert_countrycode

_Description: Local address extension character:
 Please choose the character that will be used to define a local address
 extension. This MUST match what you have set in your postfix or qmail setup.
 .
 The recipient delimiter will be used for your mailing lists. Let's say you use
 the + char as delimiter, then your users will have to send a mail to
 list+subscribe@example.com. The drawback when choosing + is that some MTA
 don't allow to send mail with this char in the recipient (namely some bad
 qmail patches are incompatibles), but when using - as delimiter, you will not
 be able to use an email of the form john-doe@example.com as - is the
 delimiter.

Template: dtc/conf_mx_mail
Type: string
Default: mx
_Description: Subdomain name for the MX server:
 Your mail server will need to use a subdomain name to accept mail. This
 subdomain will be configured in your mail server and your domain name server
 by DTC. Any name is ok here.

Template: dtc/conf_eth2monitor
Type: string
_Description: Network devices to monitor:
 Please enter all the network devices you wish to be monitored by the
 RRDTool graphing utility.

Template: dtc/conf_omit_dev_mknod
Type: boolean
Default: false
_Description: Skip mknod calls when building the chroot template?
 In some environments, such as Linux vServer, mknod cannot be
 executed. This option allows skipping the creation of the null,
 random and urandom devices during the chroot template creation.

Template: dtc/conf_enforce_adm_encryption
Type: boolean
Default: true
_Description: Enforce DTC admin password encryption?
 To enhance security in case of a breach, DTC can encrypt all
 admin passwords. If passwords are encrypted, you cannot see them
 by clicking on the magnifying glass icon (you will only see the
 encrypted version of the password), but you can always use the
 /usr/share/dtc/admin/dtcpasswdm shell script to (re)set a password.
 .
 The encryption will be applied to passwords created from now on. If
 you have existing unencrypted admin passwords that should be
 converted, see /usr/share/doc/dtc-common/README.Debian.
