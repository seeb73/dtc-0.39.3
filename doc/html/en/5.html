<h4><a name="5.1"></a>5.1 Licence</h4>

I've decided to release DTC under the GNU <a href="http://www.gnu.org">LESSER
GENERAL PUBLIC LICENCE</a> (LGPL). Feel free to download, use, and modify my
source code, but never release a commercial product with it !<br><br>

The reason why I've decided to release DTC under GPL is because
I have no intention to make money with DTC. More over, I use only
free software, and I think it is normal to participate to the free
software community if I use that kind of software. The only thing
I'd like from you is at least a hello telling you are enjoying DTC
(drop me a message in my mail, or go on IRCnet in #dtc-dev...).<br><br>

I (Thomas Goirand) was the only programmer for that. This tool was made because I was
tired of spending 15 minutes on each web account we had to configure. Now DTC is not
only a small tool for myself, but real software with features.<br><br>

The tool by itself was not so hard
to make, but what was hard, was to find out how to make all the software collection run
all together, make the install script and have it all easy to use.<br><br>

The best way to support DTC development is to use GPLHost hosting services.
