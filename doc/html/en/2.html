<h3><a name="2."></a>2. Installation</h3>

<h4><a name="2.1"></a>2.1 Before installing</h4>

Before installing DTC, apache MUST be already installed/installable, as
well as php4 (and its cgi command line version (php4-cgi under debian / php-cli under BSD)
and the mod_php4 module for apache) and mysql.<br><br>

Then, you MUST install any mail server PRIOR to installing DTC. If you need
to install mail daemons after DTC is installed, you will then need to
relaunch install the script (in /var/lib/dpkg/info/dtc.postinst for Debian
users and dtc-install.sh under BSD). Install bind (or any compatible
nameserver), make it up and running (be able to resolv and have your
/etc/resolv.conf point to 127.0.0.1). Have qmail etc. and proftpd with mod_sql
activated and running. Be ready to have one domain name to use and have
its name server IP point to the server (it can be fake, but beware then
that you will have to use tricks to resolve it).<br><br>

Under BSD or under Debian systems, the dependancy does the stuff to install
apache, mysql proftpd, and php4 with all necessary modules and options. But
because you can choose what type of MTA you will use (namely QMail/Postfix
and Courier/Dovecot/QMail), you will set them up, and then DTC will detect
them during install and modify its config files.<br><br>

<h4><a name="2.2"></a>2.2 Configuring daemons before installing</h4>

On all systems, the DTC install script will asks some vital questions.
Be ready to answer to the following:<br><br>

- MySQL database hostname<br>
- MySQL root login<br>
- MySQL root password<br>
- A domain name you will use to bind DTC's interface<br>
- The public IP address of the server<br>
- The path where files will be saved for the domains (mail,html) when creating a new account.<br>
- The root admin login/pass you will use with DTC<br>
- etc...<br><br>

<h5><a name="2.2.1"></a>2.2.1 Mysql</h5>

By default, most Unix distributions install the MySQL server with no admin password.
You have to enter one using this command unther shell prompt:<br><br>

<pre>mysql -uroot -Dmysql</pre><br>

Then issue the following SQL command:<br>
<pre>UPDATE user SET Password=PASSWORD(\'YOUR_ROOT_PASSWORD\') WHERE User=\'root\';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;</pre>

Note: in case of a lost password, you can launch mysqld with "--skip-grant-tables"
option.
 
<h5><a name="2.2.2"></a>2.2.2 Apache</h5>

You'll have to get your hands dirty editing apache httpd.conf file. Only
1 directives must be set: ServerName. Other directives are happily setup
automatically by DTC using the Unix tool sed. We consider it's up to
distribution's to do that job.<br><br>

You have to setup a default server name for apache, using the same as what you
have setup in /etc/hostname.

<pre>ServerName www.example.com</pre>

On latest versions, DTC modify itself the httpd.conf. Under debian woody and
FreeBSD, you normally have nothing to do with it.

<h4><a name="2.3"></a>2.3 Installation under Debian</h4>

DTC is not yet in Debian's official tree. But it should still work for
both Woody, Sarge and Sid flavor of Debian, the installer has been designed
to take advantage of them. Before it can once be in it, use the
following alternative source in your /etc/apt/source.list:<br>

<pre>deb ftp://gplhost.com/debian stable main</pre>

This repository also contains compiled versions of qmail-src and ucspi-tcp-src
that are given only on source versions on official repositories (for licence
problems). It's boring not convenient, so sorry for not complying to licence...<br>

On that repository you will also find the alternative password check from jedi
in a debian package (packaging done by the author of DTC), and the mysqmail package
that contains a patched version of qmail-pop3d for easy log of pop trafic, a logger,
and another checkpassword for smtp, all the above using MySQL backend. You will
also find useful debian packages like libapache-mod-log-sql (warning for
Sarge and Sid: use special package for unstable linked against the good
glibc), the sbox-dtc package (this one works on both 3 debian flavors).<br><br>

Once this repository is added, install DTC like other debian packages:<br>

<pre>apt-get install dtc</pre><br><br>

<h4><a name="2.4"></a>2.4 Installation under RedHat</h4>

The actual version of the RPM package for DTC has been done for a 7.3 redhat, but
because it is php scripts it should run on all other superior versions. It
has been successfully tested under Fedora Core 2.<br><br>

The RPM package can be downloaded there:<br><br>

<a href="ftp://ftp.gplhost.com/pub/dtc/RPMS">ftp://ftp.gplhost.com/pub/dtc/RPMS</a><br><br>

Installation is done like for any other rpm package:<br>

<pre>rpm -ivh dtc-VERSION_noarch.rpm</pre>

Because it's not possible to ask questions to user before installing a package
under RedHat, there is a post-installation script that will be installed in
/usr/share/dtc/admin/dtc.rpm-install.sh. Simply launch it.<br><br>

Please note that because I've had no return at all from redhat team, I didn't
test a that package a lot. Please send me feedback if you can.<br><br>

<h4><a name="2.5"></a>2.5 Installation under FreeBSD</h4>

DTC is now integrated in the FreeBSD ports collection. FreeBSD users can go in
/usr/ports/sysutils/dtc and issue a "make install". After preinstallation is
done, you have to manually launch the setup script (this is the way FreeB works,
not my fault) by typing dtc-install (it should be located in /usr/sbin).<br><br>

Because submitting takes time, the port may be a bit old. You can still
fetch the latest version in:
<a href="ftp://ftp.gplhost.com/pub/dtc/bsd">ftp://ftp.gplhost.com/pub/dtc/bsd</a><br><br>

Note that DTC depends on all the ports needed, and even PHP has a special slave
port for DTC.<br><br>

<h4><a name="2.6"></a>2.6 Manual installation</h4>

First download the tar archive at:<br><br>

<a href="ftp://ftp.gplhost.com/pub/dtc/generic/">ftp://ftp.gplhost.com/pub/dtc/generic/</a><br><br>

Uncompress the archive:<br>
<pre>tar -xvzf dtc_VERSION_all.tar.gz</pre>

Install uncompressed files:<br>
<pre>mkdir -p /usr/share/dtc/etc/zones
mv dtc_VERSION_all/dtc /usr/share
chown -R root:root /usr/share/dtc
chown -R nobody:nogroup /usr/share/dtc/etc</pre>

And launch the install script:<br>
<pre>dtc_VERSION_all/install.sh</pre>

The usual questions will be asked to you plus the path of the folowing
config file that the DTC install need to modify: httpd.conf, proftpd.conf, named.conf.<br><br>

Verify that your qmail install reflects something close to the following:<br>
<pre>qmaild:x:64011:65534:qmail daemon,,,:/var/qmail:/bin/sh
qmaill:x:64015:65534:qmail log,,,:/var/qmail:/bin/sh
qmailp:x:64016:65534:qmail pw,,,:/var/qmail:/bin/sh</pre>

If you want to install all by hand without using the install script, here
is how to do it:<br><br>

- First, install apache, bind, proftpd with mysql support, and qmail with either mysql support
or using the Jedi's checklocalpasswd program for authentication.
Already done ? You should either be very fast or have debian system installed !<br><br>

- Setup the database the way the "create_table.sql" describe it. You can cut-paste
this file content in phpmyadmin if you like...<br><br>

- Create some folders for dtc to store the generated files :

<pre>
# Create /etc/dtc (conf file), /etc/dtc/data (generated file path)
# and /etc/dtc/data/zone (where named zone files will be stored)
# Folder where dtc will generate its files for apache, qmail and bind :
mkdir -p /etc/dtc/data/zone
</pre>

- Make this folder accessible by your web user (it should be either nobody or www-data
depending the way things are set up...).
<pre>

chown -R nobody:nogroup /etc/dtc/data;
</pre>

- DTC will generate the following files in the /etc/dtc/data folder. You have to either
replace package files by a symlink to those files, or include these in the package file.
Let's see them one by one. Note that you can change the path to all of them in the
config.inc.php.<br><br>
DTC will generate the following files for you : named.zones - named_slave.zones - vhosts.prosites - rcpthosts - virtualdomains - assign - poppasswd<br><br>

* named.zones or named_slave.zones<br>
Include this file in your named.conf (located in /etc/bind under
debian and /etc/namedb under FreeBSD) file using the following syntax :

<pre>
include "/etc/dtc/data/named.zones";
</pre>

* vhosts.conf<br>

Include this in your /etc/apache/httpd.conf :

<pre>
Include /etc/dtc/data/vhosts.prosites
</pre>

* qmail files<br>
You have to replace the qmail files by symlinks to those files :
<pre>
rm /etc/qmail/rcpthosts; ln -s /etc/qmail/rcpthosts /etc/dtc/data/rcpthosts;
rm /etc/qmail/virtualdomains; ln -s /etc/qmail/virtualdomains /etc/dtc/data/virtualdomains;
rm /etc/qmail/users/assign; ln -s /etc/qmail/users/assign /etc/dtc/data/assign
</pre>

If you use the Jedi's checklocalpasswd :
<pre>
rm /etc/poppasswd; ln -s /etc/poppasswd /etc/dtc/data/poppasswd;
</pre>

- You have to add the following directives in /etc/proftpd.conf to enable
sql control :
<pre>
# Beware that one is deprecated in newer version of proftpd:
#	UseReverseDNS   off

	IdentLookups    off
# This is specific to mod_sql for proftpd
	SQLAuthenticate on 
	SQLConnectInfo  YOURDATABASENAME@localhost YOURSQLUSER YOURSQLPASS
	SQLUserInfo     ftp_access login password uid gid homedir shell
	SQLAuthTypes    Plaintext
</pre>
you can also add the following if you need quota support :
<pre>
	Quotas          on
	DefaultQuota    50
	QuotaType       hard
	QuotaCalc       on
	QuotaBlockName  Mbites
	QuotaBlockSize  1024000
	User            nobody
	Group           nogroup
	SQLHomedirOnDemand on
</pre>
You can also add some directives to have FTP accounting done, like the install
script does...

- Next, you have to put all the dtc php file somewhere in your apache tree so you can
browse, click, and enjoy dtc.<br><br>

<h4><a name="2.7"></a>2.7 Post-Installation (protection via .htaccess)</h4>

By default, a .htaccess file is protecting your admin directory (it should be
located in /usr/share/dtc/admin). This file contains something like this:

<pre>AuthName "A funny message prompted to user !"
AuthType Basic
AuthUserFile /var/www/.htpasswd
require valid-user</pre>

That means you have to create a .htpasswrd in /var/www. Issue the following
command to create it (a prompt will ask for password):
<pre>htpasswd -c /var/www/.htpasswd user_name</pre>
The -c option create the file. If it's not specified, then the user will be added
to that auth file.<br><br>

Don't forget that the apache directive AllowOverride tells if you can or not use
.htaccess file. Please set it to correct value or your admin panel will not be protected
and everybody will have access to it (see apache documentation...).<br><br>

In order to have bind (named) working, you have to edit the 'forwarders' part of
the main 'option' directive of named.conf. Fill it with the IP address of an accessible
name server (the one of your ISP). Don't forget to set your /etc/resolv.conf with
the following value:
<pre>nameserver 127.0.0.1
</pre>
Or your server will not resolv correctly.

<h4><a name="2.8"></a>2.8 Running DTC under a clustered environement</h4>

Many people asked me if one day DTC could handle a cluster. The answer is
that it was primarily written to hold all the services in one server only,
but it already supports it. This chapter will tell you how to do it. What we
will do here is slowly add new servers to a "normal" DTC server,
so first of all, setup a box with DTC like you already did. For the
purpose of this example, we will say that the main server is called smain,
with IP address 192.168.1.10.<br><br>

<img src="dtc_cluster.png"><br><br>

<b><u>MySQL</u></b><br>
There is no need here that I explain how to use MySQL in a cluster. Please
se <a href="http://www.mysql.org">mysql.org</a> web site to know more about
it. Remember that nearly ALL the services needs that MySQL server, and that
this one is really as critical as the file server itself.<br><br>

<b><u>The DNS server</u></b><br>
DTC automatically generates slave files for slave DNS servers. What you have
to do is to setup the IP of the main server. Login into the root DTC panel
on smain, and enter smain's IP in the &quot;Slave dns server ip address&quot;
which is 192.168.1.10 for this example. When done, you can ask DTC to generate
the named zones. The next step is to regularly (a good choice would be at
1,11,21,31,41,51 of each hours because DTC will generate its file at
0,10,20,30,40,50) upload the generated file. Do it from smain (the file is
called "named.slavezones.conf") to all the slave DNS servers you have. I have
a special good feeling with ncftpput which is rather simple for FTP upload, but
you can use whatever technique you want, including scp. When this is done,
you can schedule the reload of bind each 10 minutes for example at
2,12,22,32,42,52 of each hour. If the MySQL server crashes, then
POP3 and apache will not work anymore, but SMTP (without SQL loggin) and DNS
should still work so normally no mail is lost. This is one of the reasons I like
a lot more to use that technique over an SQL pluggin for Bind. Here, even if
smain is crashed, DNS works and mail is routed.<br><br>

<b><u>SMTP and POP3</u></b><br>
For SMTP, all is done via generated files in /var/qmail. If you only need
to use only one SMTP server, then you can only import DTC's main crontab from
smain to the slave SMTP (cron.php). Remove all the stuff that are for other
services than mail and keep only the /var/qmail config file generation stuff.
Don't forget that because DTC uses a lock flag in the database, the slave
SMTP server wont be able to run its cronjob at the same time as other servers,
so setting the cron time correctly and configuring clock from the network is
not a bad idea.<br>
If you need to have more than one SMTP server, then it will be a bit more
complicated as long as DTC is not done for it. The main problem is that
once a mail server has finished its cronjob, it will reset the value of
the cronjob table to &quot;not need to regenerate users&quot;. You have
to do something that reloads both servers. One good idea is to modify the
SMTP's cronjob so that the first server will tell the second to update
the same way he did. Anyway, Qmail can handle a lot of messages,
so if you need to do it, then you are good enough to set up the replication
of /var/qmail/ and reload qmail consequently by yourself!<br>
For the pop3 it's a lot more easy as long as it does not use flatfiles
but only a SQL connection for auth and traffic login (if you use Mysqmail).
Because of that, no file replication or daemon reload is needed.<br><br>

<b><u>Apache and squid</u></b><br>
As you may know, Squid is designed to work in both 2 directions, so it
can act as a caching server. The main advantage is that your critical
servers are not accessible from the internet, but only in the DMZ, but
it also reduces a lot the load on your HTTP servers. The second stage is
to have more than one Apache server. To do that, the only thing you have
to do is to populate all your servers with the vhosts.conf file and
reload using apachectl stop/start when the cronjob asks for it. You can
use the same technique as for the SMTP server, and once again, if it's
easy to do it with only one HTTP server, it might be a bit more
complicated on a cluster (you have to inform via network all the HTTP
servers to reload). Once this configuration is achieved, the caching server
squid can do the load balancing between all your servers (read squid
documentation to know how).<br><br>

<b><u>The file server</u></b><br>
All your customer services will need access to the file server exept DNS.
Http, ftp, pop3 and smtp services all need access to it. What I suggest
here is that you mount the same big area in all the servers using same
mountpoint for example using nfs. All the servers need is access in
read/write with user nobody:nogroup.<br><br>
