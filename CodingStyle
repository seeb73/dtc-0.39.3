DTC coding style
----------------

I always see stupid coding style files, so I thought, why not one for DTC!

* No stupid line size limit

In many projects, I see that line size are supposed to be limited to 80
cols. That's really stupid: we all have bigger monitors, we aren't in the
early 70s, come on! More over, it makes code unreadable. So please, feel free
to use more than 80 cols.

* Tabs vs spaces

In many projects, I see that they forbid the use of tabs, in the favor of
white spaces. This is overly stupid. If you do that, then move blocks of
code from one place to another, you spend your time removing a bunch of
space caracters. If the convention is to use 8 spaces, then your spending 8
times the amount of time. Lucky, PHP isn't python, but in python, that's
even more stupid, because creating loads of issues when re-indenting.

* AND vs &&

Don't use AND, use && in PHP, just like you would in C. Same with OR vs ||.

* Indenting

We don't want to save precious monitor real estate, so no need to go too
much at the next line. Something like this:

if($a){
	...
}

will be prefered over:

if($a)
{
	...
}

which doesn't increase readability. The former is just stupid habbits that
people are using because they have read the K&R bible.

That's it (for the moment).
